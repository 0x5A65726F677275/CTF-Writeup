ðŸ’£ Dr. Von Noizeman's Nuclear Bomb Defusal Writeup
Overview
Welcome to the thrilling tale of defusing Dr. Von Noizeman's Nuclear Bomb, a binary exploitation challenge that tests your reverse engineering and debugging skills! This bomb requires disarming four colored locksâ€”YELLOW, GREEN, BLUE, and REDâ€”each with unique puzzles to solve. Armed with tools like pwndbg and Ghidra, we successfully navigated the bomb's defenses and disarmed it. Below is a detailed breakdown of each phase, complete with technical insights and the solutions that saved the day!

ðŸŸ¡ Phase 1: YELLOW
Objective
Unlock the YELLOW phase by entering the correct 8-character password.
Analysis

Disassembly: The yellow function compares bytes at memory address 0x804c24c to 0x804c253 against a hardcoded sequence: 0x38, 0x34, 0x33, 0x37, 0x31, 0x30, 0x36, 0x35.
Conversion: These hex values correspond to ASCII characters: 8 (0x38), 4 (0x34), 3 (0x33), 7 (0x37), 1 (0x31), 0 (0x30), 6 (0x36), 5 (0x35).
Password: Concatenating these gives 84371065.
Behavior: If the input matches, a success message is printed, and the global variable at 0x804c124 is set to 0. Otherwise, itâ€™s shifted left by 10 bits, potentially triggering a failure.

Solution

Input: 84371065
Command: bxxx --char 0x3834333731303635
Result: The YELLOW lock disengages, and the bomb interface updates with a * in the SECONDS field, indicating progress.


ðŸŸ¢ Phase 2: GREEN
Objective
Unlock the GREEN phase by providing an 8-character password and handling an additional check to prevent a lock re-engagement.
Analysis

Disassembly: The green function calls strncmp to compare the user input at ebp-0x14 with the string at 0x804a2c0, which is dcaotdae. The comparison length is 8 bytes.
Additional Check: After a successful strncmp, the function checks a value at ebp-0x8 (initially set to 1) by performing and eax, 1. If the result is non-zero, the lock re-engages with the message "ACTION OVERRIDDEN FROM USER NOIZEV".
Buffer Overflow: The input buffer is vulnerable to overflow, as fgets allows up to 20 characters (including \n). By appending 4 A characters (0x41414141) after dcaotdae, we overwrite the lower byte of ebp-0x8 to 0x41 (odd), but the and eax, 1 check evaluates to 1, causing failure. Adjusting to 4 As ensures the correct behavior.
Memory Inspection: x/4wx $ebp-0x14 shows the input dcaotdaeAAAA\n, confirming the overflow.

Solution

Input: dcaotdaeAAAA
Result: The GREEN lock disengages, but an initial attempt with dcaotdaeAAAAA failed due to the and eax, 1 check. The correct input dcaotdaeAAAA sets ebp-0x8 appropriately, and the bomb interface updates with two *s in the SECONDS field.


ðŸ”µ Phase 3: BLUE
Objective
Navigate a circuit traversal path to produce a specific value (0x40475194) by following a sequence of L, R, or \n characters.
Analysis

Ghidra Decompilation: The blue function iterates over a 15-character buffer (0x804c24c), interpreting each character:
L: Move to the address stored at local_8 (a pointer to a structure).
R: Move to the address at local_8 + 8.
\n: Set a flag (local_10) to break the loop.
Other characters: Trigger a "boom" message and break.


XOR Operation: For each valid character, local_c (initially set to _DAT_0804c164) is XORed with the value at local_8 + 4. The final local_c must equal 0x40475194.
Trial and Error: Testing LLR resulted in local_c = 0x633d6b1c, which failed. Testing LLRR produced local_c = 0x40475194, satisfying the condition.
Success Path: The sequence LLRR navigates the structure correctly, and wire_blue is decremented, indicating success.

Solution

Input: LLRR
Result: The BLUE lock disengages, displaying "VOLTAGE REROUTED FROM REMOTE DETONATION RECEIVER", and the bomb interface updates with three *s in the SECONDS field.


ðŸ”´ Phase 4: RED
Objective
Enter a clock resynchronization sequence to match a rotating sequence derived from random numbers.
Analysis

Red Preflight: The red_preflight function generates three random numbers (r, _DAT_0804c268, _DAT_0804c26c) using rand(), displayed as hex values (6B8B4567, 327B23C6, 643C9869). These are used to compute a sequence.
Red Function: The red function compares each character of the input buffer against a lookup table (ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZ23456789) indexed by _DAT_0804c26c & 0x1f. The values _DAT_0804c26c, _DAT_0804c268, and r are rotated right by 5 bits each iteration, and the loop runs up to 19 times (buffer size limit).
Sequence Generation: Using the provided clock sync values, we compute the sequence:
Start with _DAT_0804c26c = 0x643C9869.
For each character, index the lookup table with _DAT_0804c26c & 0x1f, then rotate _DAT_0804c26c, _DAT_0804c268, and r right by 5 bits.
This produces the sequence KDG3DU32D38EVVXJM64.


Verification: The input KDG3DU32D38EVVXJM64 matches the expected sequence, setting wire_red to 0.

Solution

Input: KDG3DU32D38EVVXJM64
Result: The RED lock disengages, and the bomb interface displays a [DISARM] option, with four *s in the SECONDS field.


ðŸŽ‰ Final Disarmament

Action: Selected [DISARM] from the menu.
Outcome: The bomb is fully disarmed, but a segmentation fault occurs, likely due to a post-disarmament cleanup issue in the binary. Despite this, all locks are disengaged, and the challenge is complete!


Tools Used

pwndbg: For debugging and inspecting memory/registers.
Ghidra: For decompiling and understanding the binary's logic.
bxxx: Custom tool for testing inputs (e.g., bxxx --char for YELLOW).


Conclusion
Defusing Dr. Von Noizeman's Nuclear Bomb was a wild ride through binary exploitation! From decoding ASCII passwords in YELLOW, exploiting buffer overflows in GREEN, navigating circuit paths in BLUE, to cracking a pseudo-random sequence in RED, each phase tested our reverse engineering prowess. The bomb is disarmed, and the world is safe... for now! ðŸ˜Ž
Final Passwords:

YELLOW: 84371065
GREEN: dcaotdaeAAAA
BLUE: LLRR
RED: KDG3DU32D38EVVXJM64

Happy hacking, and stay curious!
